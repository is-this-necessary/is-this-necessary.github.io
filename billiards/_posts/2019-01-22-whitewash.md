My first game this season was outrageous. Given the huge amount of preparation at a practice table, I expected a lot, but certainly not the 8-0 score. It was brief, clocked an hour only; few errors were made. I played with a winner of multiple tournaments, who only just signed up for our club league.

And I lost.

I keep telling off myself that I'm wanting too much. Anytime I'm in a similar situation, I get punished severely. On another day, if it wasn't a ranking game I would certainly stand up for the fight. I beat higher tier players on occasions, but these are just casual, spontaneous affairs. Whenever the stakes are anything more than nothing, I go mental and can't even play the basic pot.

Colleagues advise me to take part in more tournaments to gain some proper experience in match play. In practice, I can be the best player in the world who never misses, but [it doesn't matter](https://itdoesnotmatter.github.io/) outside the training room. It is indeed my plan to start regularly attending such events. Thankfully, there's a bunch of them happening in our club.

One thing I surely cannot do is to dream about winning any of those the first time I turn in. If it happens---great! But there's no need for me to put any pressure on myself. I need to learn how to handle my emotions better. I mean, it _is_ a million times better than it was at the time I started, but there is an endless path to excellence ahead of me. I just need to keep playing and enjoy every minute of it, because I love this game :)
