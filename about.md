Hi there, lost soul! My name is Marek and I live in Poland. I retired as a Software Developer at the age of 30.

I'm not writing here for any particular audience, on any particular topic or for any concrete goals. Presumably, there's going to be a lot of mundane journal entries, not interesting to anyone (perhaps not even me).

And remember, it's _your_ fault if you got here!
