I'm not proud of yesterday's performance. I was wanting it too much, I was too confident and too orthodox. That audition might not turn out successful.

Two cute girls were before me, not sure if for the same episode or not. Does it matter? Well, I'd be cheating myself if I said I wasn't thinking about who could be my potential fiancÃ©e. I mean: in that TV show I was casting to, the one I'd be supposed to 'cuddle & kiss'. Not that I'm looking for a real one ;)

When my turn came, I was sat in a swivel chair in front of a director and one of the casting guys who would take all the remaining parts in the script. It was a small room that resembled dorms. The whole place was actually a bit like it. Not what I remember from my previous offices. There even was this funny note in the common kitchen: _'Coffee weathers, please close the lid'_. Anyway, I didn't like the setting. My energy level was suboptimal. Oh, and the reading issue: I should have practiced it that way, with the printouts rather than using computer screen.

> In the hindsight, that was one of the most important differences from the first casting. Back then, everything happened _live_, but with a sheet in hand it became so much more artificial.

If I had more experience, it probably wouldn't be a problem. But I'm only an amateur, and yet I was trying to convince them I'm more of a professional. It didn't work. The director interrupted me after the very first line I said. I agree, I was overdoing it. Perhaps theatre spoiled me. She started to instruct me that it was not what they really wanted. The tone of that rather elaborate speech has put me off even more. _'Is this necessary?'_---I was asking myself. Her rant was surely not, but I only nodded there and promised I'd try to obey in my usual polite fashion. Somehow, we got through, covering almost every part of the script and ended up in an upbeat mood.

_'OK, we got it'_---said the man, who proceeded to explain the further actions. This time a possible call was also mentioned, but not in such a strong flavour as during the first time. Maybe it's better; I won't be disappointed if I don't get it.

*[Is this necessary?]: Ask yourself at every moment, 'Is this necessary?'
