Whenever I discuss movies with anyone, and whether they liked it or not, I recall my favourite prerequisite of its badassity.  Actually, I'd argue that it is _the only one_.  The title spoiled it...

So many times it occurred during those talks that my interviewer had drastically different experience with a work of art.  It used to come with a great shock of mine, but now I just think: it wasn't meant for them.  And today I asked myself: what if the writers create their characters in a way so that it suits as many people as possible?  While it seems that for many this is exactly the goal, [does it matter](https://itdoesnotmatter.github.io/) at all?
