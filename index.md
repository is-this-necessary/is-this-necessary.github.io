Some day, this list of posts will be full of entries. I know that for sure, cause I already have about three of them (need edits) and I have a good record of keeping a journal (which hasn't seen the daylight, and will definitely not with that content!). I only need to get back to a habit of regular writing (#2k-a-day). When this list reaches the size which will severely impact going through it, I promise to myself to do some sort of pagination and categorization (tagging).

Before that happens, here they are as they are.
