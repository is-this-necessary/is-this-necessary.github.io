Don Draper. What class. Or is he? Permanent drunkard, liar, constantly cheating on his wives. Hmm, if only I was married, this would sound very true for me as well. It's not gonna be the first time if I mention my very much liked ability to identify myself with the story characters. It's Don's turn now.


A Suit. Finally.
================

One thing I adore about those _Mad Men_ times is how elegant they wore. I feel like I could go back in time just for that; to be able to wear a suit every day and not be frowned upon. The hell with it, I should actually try this, even if people laugh at me. It doesn't have to be a full suit, or a formal one. There's dozens of more casual yet neat options. I'm thinking of spending a whole month's salary on clothes. In fact, I dream of getting a big wardrobe with multiple sets of the same things. There would be some variety of course, but having them in numbers would take much of the decision paralysis out of my head. Think Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein. Or that scientist from _The Fly_.

Oh, lets not forget about a suitcase. I do have something that resembles an elegant suitcase, to the point people might mistake me for some businessman. This is what I looked like for my last job interview. A white-blue striped shirt, light beige trousers, brown belt and shoes. It's a pity that this suitcase-wannabe is black, but I could tell I was making an impression. And I definitely felt that woman's press of bosom on me in the tram. Call it impression if you want.


A Scent of a Woman
==================

I never thought I would meet her again in the bus after I stopped by at a mall. It was quite a long moment, I was wondering how that happened. Maybe it was her only option to get home and she had to wait that much. Maybe she did some extra shopping as well. Anyway, on the bus I could see her vis-a-vis. She was smiling to something on the phone, her headphones in, not sure what that was, but probably not a conversation. It was a nice smile. Nice, but not perfect teeth; she saw me only after a while (I think).

Gosh, she magnetised me in that tram before. When I was heading to the mall, I looked back in the station's direction in regret as she moved in a nice manner. She wore that gray, buttoned sweater, put on a black top, which revealed her arms. She did reveal them actually, pulling the sweater a little lower. Maybe it was because of the heat, but maybe she wanted me to feel her neck, her soft skin and her nice smell. I like girls with skin like this: immaculate, spotless!

The top fragments of her bra were visible through that small blouse. It had red elements. She got black hair. Very nice hair indeed, thick. Long lashes, I wonder if they were fake. But they looked rather nice. And she had that small mole near the lips. Definitely charming. I had to keep myself from staring in her cleavage, or at her face, but at the same time I wished for any physical contact. Not that difficult at rush hour in a crowded tram. One thing I was rather comfortable at watching were her feet. A nice pair of smallish, but chubby fingered feet. And those ballerina shoes tied high on the calf. I wish she wasn't wearing long jeans; those ties always look awesome on bare legs.

There was an aura of inaccessibility around her. Along with not that good looking sticked nails I noticed some rings on her middle finger. I can rarely guess if they are engagement, wedding or neither. Those looked like they could be any of the above. Fuck that. I wasn't going to start a conversation anyway. Hell, I can't even complement a woman on her looks! That's why I'm thinking of a way to do it other than by saying.


Business Card (Not)
===================

Wouldn't it be charming if I secretly handed her my card, barely even looking in her eye for a moment, not speaking a word? Only that it wouldn't really be my card, i.e. with name and address on it. It would just say _You're amazing :)_ -- or something like this. Mono type font, actually typewriter-like could do it. Really simple stuff: a few small words in the middle of a regular-sized business card. How would that play out like? Sublime, I hope.

I thought of it for a couple of months now maybe. So often I meet a gorgeous woman in a tram or bus! Sometimes we do share smiles, but those are rather outliers. Mmm, like with that terrific blonde a few days ago. She wore tight red dress, similar ballerina shoes (but without ties). Absolutely fantastic! I almost died, but we actually looked each other in the eye for a moment. It was good to feel that again. She deserved the very best of those cards that I plan to get.

I want them with different texts. Maybe I could hand them out randomly? _You're beautiful_ is such a clich√©; I prefer words _charming, enchanting, mesmerizing, magical, exceptional, unique_. And that's only one pattern. There could also be something like: _Great hair/nails/whatever!_, _Nice style!_, or even single worded, like: _Class_. It is now my resolution to have those printed out and always at avail after I get myself a nice briefcase for a new laptop in my new job. If only I get that new job...
