The guys were talking about Redis, which reminded me that I need to dump my brain shit as well. Such miserable times for me lately, I barely got out of bed today (near 1PM...). The load must have gotten pretty heavy in my head. I guess I needed that break from any work over the weekend. And more importantly, some physical exercise. Yes, I finally cut the grass! I'm so proud of myself; did it manually, with only the primal tools, no electricity involved. It got me some tan as well. And organised that mess over the wall a bit. It's not perfect yet, but I'm getting there.


Perfectly Brewed Coffee
=======================

Q., D. and I sat at a bar together last Friday. I was already well-done when we got there. Add to that a funny cigarette and you get a mix for a typical conversation of loons. Half of the time I was banging my fingers over the top with a half-awake stare into nothingness. The other half we talked about a variety of topics. One of them was coffee.

B. was preparing a drink using a dripper. This triggered an engaged exchange between me and D. We did circa 5 or 7 high fives during that, amazed that we both turned out to be coffee geeks. He taught me a nice trick to go by without a thermometer: you open the kettle after it boiled the water and wait around two minutes for a litre to go down to 96 degrees. I hope I remember the numbers right, but anyway, since I started doing it (opening the kettle and waiting a bit more), I noticed the coffee is much more different. Better, no doubt about that. But when I get the scales, it could go beyond better, very close to perfect I guess. Maybe I'll get a proper coffee machine first?


Red Sun Next to a Black Hole
============================

When I said I stared at an indescribable emptiness, I kind of mis conveyed the message. I knew very well where to look at to be able to notice some fine details of a new stellar object in the sky. She is absolutely gorgeous! If I stayed there any longer, my eyes would have gotten wet from her shine. I almost collided with her trajectory once. Fortunately, I had some decency left to excuse her and let her go first.

She wore two rings on both of her ring fingers. They kind of looked like engagement rings, sadly, but you never know with girls like these. Her nails were nicely done, in all colors, with some graphics. Pretty little hands, that's what I like. A beautiful face, healthy hair and loads of charm. She enchanted me.

We had two rounds with the boys and it was almost time to go. I figured, that I'd ask M. if she's in any relationship. Fuck, I almost did that. Very quickly I came up with an opener which turned out to be a closer as well. I asked him about pool tournaments in Pik and said it would be nice to play together. I don't even know if she saw that, but I sensed that M. didn't have the time for a longer exchange. Of course, he was at work, and the place was full of people. Duh...

There's nothing to worry about anyway, nothing lost just yet. There will be plenty of opportunities every week. Not like in that other case of study from that night...


Sun Rays and the Meaning of Life
================================

If I had to pick the most wicked line I ever used to hook up with a girl, it would have to be this one. Good god, a pair of scissors! My goodness...

I was getting back from that bar. I felt very sleepy. The moment I closed my eyelids sitting in a tram was so relaxing. It slowed the time for me. I had no idea it was already after eleven when I got out at the station. I saw her immediately after we started walking for a change. No wonder: she was wearing a red dress and high heels. Short blonde hair. Not too short though, just over the neck. Couldn't see her face. But the legs were solid.

She knew that a rather long walk is in front of her. I was still hoping that I would catch a bus, but when I got to the second station I realised that wasn't gonna happen. I must have been swearing pretty loud there in disgust. But she was already walking up the hill. All the other people dispersed. My head was killing me. I hesitated whether or not I was going to puke. Luckily, a little bit of walking cured the nausea.

So I turned round the corner, crossed the street and started up that old sidewalk. Then I noticed the red object not far away, along the same route. Holy shit, there was no one else in the vicinity. My only thoughts were: "You cannot freak her out, don't you scare her!" What else would you be thinking? I can see it all the time when discharging at a bus stop in late evenings. Girls either rush or stop, pretending they do something on their phone, only not to walk just next to you. They also don't like anyone creeping behind them. Not ideal situation for a flirt.

With those high heels, she couldn't cover that slope fragment fast. I overtook her somewhere in the middle. I glanced over her face. She looked noticeably more mature than I guessed. I couldn't make out any word of my mouth then. It was killing me while I continued the walk in shame and resignation. We were reaching the traffic lights at the top of the hill. And here you are: red! What a blessing! And guess what? She didn't stand next to me, only some 2 or 3 meters behind. I told you girls are afraid of it.

I must have leaned my head a bit to be able to notice that. But I couldn't come up with anything to start a conversation. The green light lit, and she almost reached me due to my slower pace. We crossed the street and happened next to a bus stop. There they were lying. A pair of fucking scissors on a sidewalk! I crouched to pick them up and threw them into a bin. At this moment she passed me and I instinctively started: "A pair of scissors. Have you seen them, Madame?" She got her headphones out of her ears and I said that I just picked them up and discarded. To this she answered: "It's good that you did that. Someone else would've done it anyway." Then I went on wondering who the hell could lose their scissors. She thought it was probably a girl and I joked that it could be a hairdresser. In the middle of a fucking night! That was crazy.

There was hardly any moment of silence. I did really well. Somehow I found all the proper links in my brain. I connected this with the fact of my recent finding: that Neil de Grass Tyson's book about the Universe. People lose all the kinds of things, I said. This one I got in a tram. On the last stop, the very same one that I saw this girl the first time. It did me a great favour there, that book. I must have seemed pretty curious to the lady; she listened carefully to my musings about the meaning of life. She kept the dialogue offering some of her own precious thoughts. She smiled a lot. And slowed the pace visibly, as if she wanted this moment to last longer.

I fucked this up eventually. When we got to a distant point where our paths crossed, I did nothing to follow it up. I only offered a handshake and my best wishes to find a good life. She did the same. No prolonged gazes. No offer of a longer walk, or sharing phone numbers, going out for coffee proposition. Nothing. Into the black hole. Will I ever meet her again?
